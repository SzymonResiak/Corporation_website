# CleaningServiceWeb

Student's project, our job was to create cleaning service website for employees and employers. In a team of three, we decided to build a website using Git version control.
An additional goal is to develop group work, therefore work on the website will be carried out using the SCRUM methodology withing every aspect of it.
All of our work, commits and functions in the team through the projects will be in this repository for our lecturer and future employers.
Whole website will be coded in Python Django using Visual Studio Code.
